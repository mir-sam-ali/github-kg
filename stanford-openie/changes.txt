## Return values
   Return information from FlexForm, SG's primary form builder interface, is in this format:
    (button, (value1, value2, ...))
Don't forget all those ()'s of your values won't be coreectly assigned.
If you have a SINGLE value being returned, it is written this way:
    (button, (value1,))
Forgetting the comma will mess you up but good
## All Widgets / Elements
This code utilizes as many of the elements in one form as possible.
    with FlexForm('Everything bagel', AutoSizeText=True, DefaultElementSize=(30,1)) as form:
        layout = [[Text('Here they all are!', Size=(30,1), Font=("Helvetica", 25), TextColor='red')],
                  [Text('Here is some text with font sizing', Font=("Helvetica", 15))],
                  [InputText()],
                  [Checkbox('My first checkbox!'), Checkbox('My second checkbox!', Default=True)],
                  [Radio('My first Radio!', "RADIO1", Default=True), Radio('My second checkbox!', "RADIO1")],
                  [Multiline(DefaultText='This is the DEFAULT text should you decide not to type anything', Scale=(2, 10))],
                  [InputCombo(['choice 1', 'choice 2'], Size=(20, 3))],
                  [Text('_'  * 90, Size=(60, 1))],
                  [Text('Choose Source and Destination Folders', Size=(35,1))],
                  [Text('Source Folder', Size=(15, 1), AutoSizeText=False), InputText('Source'), FolderBrowse()],
                  [Text('Destination Folder', Size=(15, 1), AutoSizeText=False), InputText('Dest'), FolderBrowse()],
                  [SimpleButton('Your Button with any text you want')],
                  [SimpleButton('Big Text', Size=(12,1), Font=("Helvetica", 20))],
                  [Submit(), Cancel()]]
        (button, (values)) = form.LayoutAndShow(layout)
        MsgBox('Results', 'You clicked {}'.format(button),'The values returned from form', values , Font = ("Helvetica", 15))
This is a somewhat complex form with quite a bit of custom sizing to make things line up well.  This is code you only have to write once.  When looking at the code, remember that what you're seeing is a list of lists.  Each row contains a list of Graphical Elements that are used to create the form.

Clicking Submit caused the form call to return and the call to MsgBox is made to display the results.
